	2.2 What could happen if you run your query on an instance with cycles? and why
	
    Answer:
			The instance with cycles would be rejected by my query if I run my query
            on an instance with cycles, because both of origin and destination are 
            defined as the primary keys, that is, the query will not be allowed to 
            add any duplicate data into the train table by default if the data already
            occur. Therefore, the invalid data such as the instance with cycles will be
            rejected by default and it won't impact the result of my query,
